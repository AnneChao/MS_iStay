MS_iStay (R code and data for graphics in 2025 Ecological Monographs paper by Chao et al.)

R code and data are provided for plotting all figures in the paper "A continuum of information-based temporal stability measures and their decomposition across hierarchical levels". Before using the R code, you must download the package "iStay" from Anne Chao's Github. 

The data used for examples are based on (i) Biomass time series data: 21 years(2003, 2005-2024) of time series data for 76 plots from the Jena Experiment;  and (ii) Metacommunity biomass time series data: 22 years(2003-2024) of time series data for 20 metacommunities from the Jena Experiment. Both datasets are available through the "iStay" package on Anne Chao's Github. 

"MS_iStay" includes the following files:

(1) "R code.R": Main code for plotting all figures (Figure 1 to 4 in the paper).

(2) "Source R code.txt": Source R code. 

(3) "Brief guide iStay.docx": introduction to iStay and a brief guide to R code for making graphics in Chao et al. 2025 paper.

(4) "Environment.RData": output.
